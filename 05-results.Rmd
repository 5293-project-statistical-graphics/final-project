## Quantity Pattern
We firstly focus on the quantity pattern of these two packages. And then explore some rules for pandemic.
```{r}
commits <- read_csv("resources/data/commits.csv")
issue <- read_csv("resources/data/issues.csv")
pull <- read_csv("resources/data/pull_requests.csv")
```

```{r}
#bar plot 
g1<-commits %>%
  select(date,repo) %>%
  mutate(created_wday=wday(date,label=T)) %>%
  group_by(repo,created_wday) %>%
  count(name="number") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=created_wday,y=number))+
  geom_col()+
  facet_wrap(~repo)+
    labs(x = "created at (weekday)", y = "number of commits",
       title = "Number of commits created per weekday")
# issue per weekday
g2<-issue %>% 
  select(repo, created_at, author_association) %>%
  mutate(created_wday=wday(created_at, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(repo, author_association, created_wday) %>%
  count(name="number") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = created_wday, y = number)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_grid(~repo) +
  labs(x = "created at (weekday)", y = "number of issues",
       title = "Number of issues created per weekday")

# pull per weekday
g3<-pull %>% 
  select(repo, created_at, author_association) %>%
  mutate(created_wday=wday(created_at, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(repo, author_association, created_wday) %>%
  count(name="number") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = created_wday, y = number)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_grid(~repo) +
  labs(x = "created at (weekday)", y = "number of pull request",
       title = "Number of pull request created per weekday")

library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(g2,g3,g1,ncol=2)
```

Users of Github prefer to create pull requests, issues and commits during weekdays rather than weekends. The number of all pull requests, issues and commits for plotly are smaller than ggplot2. ggplot2 is more popular than plotly on Github.


```{r}
commits$date<-as.Date(commits$date)
g4<-commits %>%
  select(repo,date) %>%
  mutate(year=year(date)-2000) %>%
  group_by(repo,year) %>%
  count(name="number") %>%
  filter(year!=22) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=number))+geom_line()+facet_wrap(~repo)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=7:21)+
  labs(x="created at(year)",y="number of commits",title="Number of commits")

# issue per year
g5<-issue %>% 
  select(repo, created_at) %>%
  mutate(created_year=year(created_at) - 2000) %>%
  group_by(repo, created_year) %>%
  count(name = "number") %>%
  filter(created_year != 22)  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = created_year, y = number)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~repo) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 9:21) +
  labs(x = "created at (year)", y = "number of issues",
       title = "Number of issues")

g6<-pull %>% 
  select(repo, created_at) %>%
  mutate(created_year=year(created_at) - 2000) %>%
  group_by(repo, created_year) %>%
  count(name = "number") %>%
  filter(created_year != 22)  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = created_year, y = number)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~repo) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 9:21) +
  labs(x = "created at (year)", y = "number of pull",
       title = "Number of pull request")
library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(g5,g6,g4,ncol=2)
```

For plotly, the number of issues and commits first increases and then has a decreasing trend after 2016. And for number of pull request of plotly, it has a decreasing trend. For ggplot2, the number of issues, pull requests and commits have a fluctuate process.  
Users are more interested in the package when it newly came out. After pandemic, less focus is put on these two packages.  
In particular, the number of commits for ggplot2 has a significant period fluctuation during time.   

```{r}
g7<-issue %>% 
  select(repo, author_association, created_at) %>%
  mutate(created_year=year(created_at) - 2000) %>%
  mutate(author_association=case_when(author_association=="COLLABORATOR"~"MEMBER",
                                      author_association=="CONTRIBUTOR"~"CONTRIBUTOR",
                                      author_association=="MEMBER"~"MEMBER",
                                      author_association=="NONE"~"NONE")) %>%
  group_by(repo, author_association, created_year) %>%
  count(name = "number") %>%
  filter(created_year != 22)  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = created_year, y = number, color = author_association)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~repo) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 9:21) +
  labs(x = "created at (year)", y = "number of issues",
       title = "Number of issues created")
g8<-pull %>% 
  select(repo, author_association, created_at) %>%
  mutate(created_year=year(created_at) - 2000) %>%
  mutate(author_association=case_when(author_association=="COLLABORATOR"~"MEMBER",
                                      author_association=="CONTRIBUTOR"~"CONTRIBUTOR",
                                      author_association=="MEMBER"~"MEMBER",
                                      author_association=="NONE"~"NONE")) %>%
  group_by(repo, author_association, created_year) %>%
  count(name = "number") %>%
  filter(created_year != 22)  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = created_year, y = number, color = author_association)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~repo) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 9:21) +
  labs(x = "created at (year)", y = "number of pull requests",
       title = "Number of pull requests created")
grid.arrange(g7,g8,ncol=1)
```

Due to the same meaning in the definition of "COLLABORATOR" and "MEMBER" in these two packages, we combine these two classes into "MEMBER". Issues are mainly created by common users of these packages. Pull requests are mostly created by members of these packages. Due to pandemic, these packages are not as popular as before.


```{r}
g9<-issue %>% 
  select(repo, comments, author_association) %>%
  mutate(author_association=case_when(author_association=="COLLABORATOR"~"MEMBER",
                                      author_association=="CONTRIBUTOR"~"CONTRIBUTOR",
                                      author_association=="MEMBER"~"MEMBER",
                                      author_association=="NONE"~"NONE"))%>%
  filter(comments < 15) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = comments, y = repo, fill = stat(quantile))) +
  stat_density_ridges(quantile_lines = FALSE, calc_ecdf = TRUE, bandwidth = 1,
                      geom = "density_ridges_gradient") +
  facet_wrap(~author_association) +
  scale_fill_brewer(name = "quantile", labels = c("1st", "2nd", "3rd", "4th")) + 
  theme_ridges()

g10<-pull %>% 
  select(repo, comments, author_association) %>%
  mutate(author_association=case_when(author_association=="COLLABORATOR"~"MEMBER",
                                      author_association=="CONTRIBUTOR"~"CONTRIBUTOR",
                                      author_association=="MEMBER"~"MEMBER",
                                      author_association=="NONE"~"NONE"))%>%
  filter(comments < 15) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = comments, y = repo, fill = stat(quantile))) +
  stat_density_ridges(quantile_lines = FALSE, calc_ecdf = TRUE, bandwidth = 1,
                      geom = "density_ridges_gradient") +
  facet_wrap(~author_association) +
  scale_fill_brewer(name = "quantile", labels = c("1st", "2nd", "3rd", "4th")) + 
  theme_ridges()
grid.arrange(g9,g10,ncol=1)
```

Both packages have similar distribution shape for all author associations and they all have long right tail. And there is a small peak for comments equal to 10 for plotly. Comparing two packages, ggplot2 is more likely to have a heavy tail.
