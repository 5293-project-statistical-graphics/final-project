Both ggplot2 and plotly uses GitHub for version control and code management. And we would like to see and compare the development of these two packages through data crawled from GitHub REST API. Specifically, we will crawl commits of main branch, issues, and pull requests for both packages. And the problems we have are:  

1) The quantity pattern of pull requests, issues and commits for these two packages during time.  
2) The solving pattern of pull requests and issues for these two packages.  
3) Whether the pandemic has an impact on the development of these two packages.
