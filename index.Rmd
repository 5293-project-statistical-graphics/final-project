# Introduction

Nowadays, plots are popular among all fields because of its conciseness and clearness. R is famous as a great and helpful tool to complete a nice plot. In R packages, ggplot2 and plotly are two well-known and common tools. But they are of different types, both in attributions and results they provide. 
ggplot2 is an open-sourced data visualization package created by Hadley Wickham. ggplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics. And plotly is a commercial package and popular these years though it is younger than ggplot2. Plotly is designed by a technical computing company.
Due to the difference of these two packages, different group of people may have diverse preference. Plotly has simple syntax and is compatible with many languages. Plotlyâ€™s visualization library offers users enhanced interactivity features, such as the ability to interact with graphs on display and zoom in and out. In terms of ggplot2, ggplot2 allows users to incorporate various forms of complexity to their visualizations without additional hassle, and also remove them with ease if necessary.   
There is an increasing trend to use Github as a tool for computer science and other computer related field. Especially, we learn the instructions of Github in class. And the data of Github can reflect some information of the update process of packages, so we can focus on ggplot2 and plotly and try to explore the information of these packages.   
The topic we are interested in is the differences between these two packages in Github development. When the users want to involve in the development of packages, they will pull requests on the Github and then issue some problems that they think should be solved. After these messages are posted on the Github, some other users will see them and try to fix them. And then they can also create their commits to Github to share it with others. With their cooperation, the packages will develop and update. In this situation, the problems that we have is that:  
1) The quantity pattern of pull requests, issues and commits for these two packages during time.  
2) The solving pattern of pull requests and issues for these two packages.  
3) Whether the pandemic has an impact on the development of these two packages.
