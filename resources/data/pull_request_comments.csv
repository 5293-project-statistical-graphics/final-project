298816092,thijsdhollander,CONTRIBUTOR,2019-06-30T02:34:08Z,"I think you may have misunderstood the intention of @jdtournier's initial wording here. The l and m information indicates the parameterisation, i.e. just like the volume number (as an alternative parameterisation) does as well.  The bit between brackets is merely a description of the definition for said parameters.  E.g., for l=2 and m=-2, the definition of the function implies that you have to compute the imaginary part of the l=2 and m=2 SH.  The confusion might stem from the different use of m as a parameter: the first m (in this example -2) is a parameter of the ""modified"" SH basis, i.e. the one we define here in; whereas the second m is a parameter of the ""standard"" or ""unmodified"" SH that is used ""within"" the definition of the ""modified"" SH basis.  My wording here is on purpose a bit informal, but I suppose you get the point.

Just as a more formal example, I think one of the first ones (or at least one of the most often referred to) is Maxime's early PhD paper where he used symmetrical SH to model ADCs: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrm.20948 .  See equation 11 in there. It might not be exactly the basis used in mrtrix, but the general format of defining it is the same.  The original version of the documentation here defines the basis in function of volume number, similar to how Maxime's paper defines it in function of parameter ""j"".  The ""j"" parameter (or volume index) itself is defined in function of l and m (see the sentence before equation 11 in the paper). Finally there is equation 11 itself, which explains how this is then actually evaluated, and part of that is an ""unmodified"" SH evaluation; but for some values of m you have to take the real part, and for others the imaginary part; and this choice indeed depends on the sign of m.

So long story short: the original documentation here is very much in line to the way in which this is usually formally defined in the literature.  But the brevity of the documentation might lead to confusion.  I would therefore personally argue the brevity is the problem; but rather than making individual command documentation excessively long, it might be wise to keep it short on purpose, and include a reference to another place (this might e.g. be a documentation page), where there is enough space / flexibility / words to describe this in detail in a way that doesn't allow for confusion.  My final 2 cents would be that most users don't need this in detail in the command description; it's a lot of lines that they probably want to scroll past each time again just to look up the name of an option of said command, in my experience the most common use of the inline docs for many frequent users.  Users that require this description, are probably at least already trying to port information between software packages, or are implementing stuff on their own.  They would probably look into more detailed docs anyway, rather than going by a command description.",https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/pull/1635#discussion_r298816092,mrtrix3

Thread safety is not a concern because merging happens in a single thread, and the current code uses an ArrayList to hold objects, which is not thread safe either.

@eolivelli the point is to avoid switching back and forth between maps and list during the merging time.  

Ideally, the model would be changed so that Plugin, Dependency and other merged objects would implement `equals` and `hashCode` instead of relying on `computeXxxKey`.  And those objects would be stored in a `Set` rather than a `List`.  But I didn't want to break compatibility at all, so I haven't changed the data structures.
I also did not want to risk breaking compatibility by using a non complete List implementation, so I decided to revert to the List whenever it is actually accessed (which does not happen during project build, but could be in maven plugins later).
I've chosen to try to keep full compatibility, but if you prefer a more conside code without the duplicate map/list backend, I can refactor, but there will be a risk of breaking compatibility.",https://github.com/apache/maven/pull/262#discussion_r298830893,maven

---

Separately: I think it might be neat to have a tool that does transforms *on schemas*, which we could use to (for example) drop all the 'rename's.  Dropping all the 'rename's in a schema would produce a topologically/cardinalically equivalent schema -- meaning we could map data described by one schema into the transformed schema guaranteed losslessly -- and then we could do things like easily have compact representations on the wire, using one schema, and flip it into more ""debug-friendly"" representations at will.

(This is all something we could also build special features for, but I think it might just ""fall out naturally"" from the rest of the foundational work, which would be neat.)

Some other LC obversations. (I wrote this because I think alot of people think LC is better then she actually is because infinite damage lul). 
-LC is exceptionally easy to counter in OAA with just item purchases (linkens, full tank or eblade). People can easily get tankier faster then you get duel wins (Aura items amplify this issue). 
-Most heroes which get hard countered by strong dispels are bad, this is a large reason why you would pick LC. 
-LC doesn't really excell in teamfights, she is more of a pickoff hero. OAA is basically 5v5 teamfights after 10 minutes. LC doesn't mesh well into this playstyle.)
- There are alot of heroes which just counter LC (especially supports). These are OAA supports so they can have any item to prevent you from killing them with duel. 
- LC really struggles for items. Blademail duration is insanely nerfed and is only good on Axe (It doesn't get its dota duration until level 4. Lol?). If you go full damage so you can kill people in duels you have no HP. If you go a balanced build you don't have enough damage to kill people.

298827596,KrisThielemans,COLLABORATOR,2019-06-30T10:37:45Z,"Naming here is very confusing, and it isn't helped by STIR's convention of using `additive_sino` for the normalised background, so I'm not sure if this is all correct. Let me try to write down what is happening.

`add_projdata_sptr` is set from `background projdata filename`. That is supposed to be the randoms.

If 3D,
1. `add_projdata_3d_sptr = add_projdata_sptr` (it's just saved, but the naming seems suspicious as we'd better be sure it is never used for `set_additive_proj_data_sptr`)
2. `back_projdata_3d_sptr` is filled with `add_projdata_3d_sptr ` (saved to `tmp_background_data.hs`). This will be the randoms.
3. `add_projdata_2d_sptr` = `SSRB(add_projdata_3d_sptr)`, i.e. effectively 2D randoms
4, `back_projdata_2d_sptr` is filled with `norm*SSRB(add_projdata_3d_sptr)` (and saved to `tmp_background_data_2d.hs`)

if 2D
1. `add_projdata_2d_sptr = add_projdata_sptr`
2. `back_projdata_2d_sptr` is currently not set at all (commented out)

Then
```
 if (export_2d_projdata)
        back_projdata_sptr = this->back_projdata_2d_sptr;
    else
        back_projdata_sptr = this->back_projdata_3d_sptr;
```
I can't understand see why the `export_2D` variable is used (the name doesn't seem to fit its purpose). I guess you use it to distinguish between 2D and 3D processing. a bit confusing.

Finally,
```
    iterative_object->get_objective_function_sptr()->set_additive_proj_data_sptr(this->back_projdata_sptr);
```
This will only work if `back_projdata_sptr` is the ""normalised background""., but that seems ONLY the case if 3D and `export_2D==true`.

This seems therefore incorrect in some cases, but we might have been lucky.

- The value that is returned is assigned to in the previous line.
- The return statement is the last statement in the method.

Does it make more sense now to have this comment? I think I may have accidentally copied the wrong comment here, hence the confusion. To reduce the confusion, I've renamed the comment to ""do_not_assign_and_return"". Does that make things more clear?

298853423,tellthemachines,CONTRIBUTOR,2019-06-30T23:15:12Z,"Apologies, I'm not sure I explained this very clearly above. What I meant to say is that there is no problem with using `vw` when setting a `max-width`. Viewport units are widely supported and implementation across browsers is consistent, so their behaviour is stable and predictable. Thus, we should not be reluctant to use them where necessary. 
Setting a `max-width` of `100vw` will not cause a scrollbar to appear. As I was trying to explain above, the only situation where unwanted scrollbars can occur is when setting `100vw` as **width**. `width` and `max-width` have quite distinct behaviours, and when using `max-width` with `100vw`, the computed width of the element will never be higher than the width of its parent elements, so no chance of scrollbars.

In this particular situation, setting a `max-width` of `100vw` for the sticky warning will ensure that, no matter what styles are applied to its parent elements, this element will never overflow the viewport. Because this is a sticky component, it is crucial that we ensure users are able to close it, so we need to be extra careful that the close button never disappears.

The problem with avoiding `vw` and instead unsetting the `min-width` and `overflow-x` on the body element is that as soon as someone sets another `min-width` further up the tree, this component will break again. This is a codebase with a lot of contributors, and even the seasoned ones don't know the reasoning behind every line of code by heart. And we can't hope to be aware of every single line that's added every day. So even though we're all doing our absolute best here, with this sort of issue it pays to take a preventive stance. 

The other problem with unsetting the overflow on the body is that as soon as we do that we will have to quickly fix a bunch of components causing horizontal scrolls, not only on the `wp-admin` side but on the block editor as well. For instance, this is the recent implementation of the columns block placeholder, on a 700px viewport at 250% zoom:

It's purpose here is to separate read/close opeartions, no matter how strange this may sound to you, this is what was intended. We have read operation in `IsClosed` and we have close operation in `Close`. We need to close the `done` channel right after the socket is closed, but while it is in the process of closing, we don't want read operations to occur. Simply, the channel won't get closed in time, thus `IsClosed` will return false leading to the error being returned from `Serve`. Removing `doneMx` causes the data race in this particular case.

298828751,tindzk,MEMBER,2019-06-30T11:09:57Z,"At the moment, IntelliJ imposes two limitations on the directory layout of modules, particularly:

- The root path of a module cannot overlap with another module's root path
- A module's source and test files must be in folders underneath the configured root path

I checked sbt-projectmatrix's sources and it does provide any possibility to customise the platform paths.

At least for Seed we can partially fix the IDEA project generation with the following settings:

```
[module.pine]
root = ""src/main/scala""
...
 
[module.pine.jvm]
root = ""src/main/scala-jvm""
...
 
[module.pine.js]
root = ""src/main/scala-js""
...
```

This satisfies the first requirement from above, but the test folder is not underneath the root path anymore. The project generation still works as expected and IntelliJ will now hide the tests.

I am fine with the new file structure given that developers will not notice anything unless they want to write test cases. Hopefully, IntelliJ's module restrictions will be lifted in the future.",https://github.com/sparsetech/pine/pull/55#discussion_r298828751,pine

In fact Boulder is generating some logs after it started. Here is for instance, from `docker-compose up` through the `run_acme_server`, the output starting to be generated in the terminal while running a `certonly` certbot command against this local Boulder instance.

I made a xstrdup helper function using xmemdup function. It also handles the
case of passing a NULL to strdup, which by standard is undefined.

Currently I'm leaving a permanent leak of the copied environment, not sure, how
strict you are on leak checking with valgrind, otherwise I free it at the end, I think
it will solve itself anyway in the next step, when I split of the ARGV and the parseenv
parsing, so I leave it for now.

Maybe it's better to export as few types and functions as possible and the usability is not much worse in this case. A package user probably mostly uses 2 or 3 backends, so it's just a few more lines of code for checking potential errors in those 2 or 3 cases.

This would also allow us to change the `NewStore` factory function to accept variadic parameters. It could look like this:
`func NewStore(options Options, backends ...gokv.Store) (Store, error)`.

Also, it's currently not optional to use this type for convenience, because the current `NewStore` function takes an `Options` argument which only contains `Backend`s instead of `gokv.Store`s. But what the package user's code is structured in a way that there are already initialized, working stores and its known that there are no errors? In this case using `MustBackend()` is required and leads to some extra lines of code.

This also feels like a level of indirection. It's easier for a package user to understand if he can create a combiner directly with multiple stores.

Capturing the essence of a song can be considered a herculean feat for a mapper. This map gets the job done. [Vell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3414541) once again takes off the brakes and delivers another masterpiece of contemporary mapping with sukekiyo's song ""focus"". In tune with the music along [Darky1](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3372928)'s storyboard, the map follows the baroquian motif of vanitas through which it blooms into a thundering roar of raw emotion to then just as quickly fade away into nothingness.

```
def try_request(func, *args, **kwargs):
  try:
    resp = await func(*args, **kwargs)
  except ExchangeDataAccuracyError as e:
    return {""error"": ""exchange_data_accuracy_error"", ""description"": str(e)}, 400

I'd advocate still simplifying these 3 lines:

```python
for missing_init in identify_missing_init_files([target_workdir]):
  Path(missing_init).touch()
```

Couple reasons I'm advocating for this:
1. Consistency with how we handle missing `__init__.py` in the rest of the codebase.
1. Less code.
1. Makes the `Path()` creation simpler. `identify_missing_init_files()` will return back the whole file path, so you don't need `os.path.join` anymore.

--

As an aside, if you were to keep this original version, you could use `pathlib.Path`'s use of the `/` operator in place of `os.path.join`, like this:

```python
(Path(root) / dirname / '__init__.py').touch()
```

The Active Record pattern is a favorite for a lot of ORMs and it makes the model responsible of its own data layer abstraction as well. So you have things like (Rails' ActiveRecord ORM):
```rb
user = User.find_by(name: 'Lee')
user.name = 'Lee üßõüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è'
user.save
```

Separating the business logic from the data layer would be the Data Mapper pattern, which may not look as pretty, but is more easily optimizable.

The `create` method no longer returns anything, because the `obj` that is created inside the session is disconnected once the create returns. Therefore, we can't do anything with the return any way.

```haskell
type family AlwaysStuck :: Symbol

```haskell
type Bug = IfStuck AlwaysStuck (TypeError (Text ""Stuck!"")) (Pure (() :: Constraint))

foo :: Bug => ()
foo = ()

somehow the type family evaluates to `() :: Constraint`, and therefore `foo` doesn't the `Stuck!` type error. But `AlwaysStuck` is, as it implies, *always stuck.*

What's going on here? *The kinds matter.* `IfStuck` won't even compare against the `T1` or the `9999999999999` cases, because neither of those things has kind `Symbol`. And so it will just boop out the `IfStuck a b c = Eval c` case!

I see a few better options: 
1. Use your current subtype and the instrumented method name as the action.
2. Use `hibernate` as subtype and `search` as action.
3. If you can tell the underlying search engine (eg Lucene or Elasticsearch) - we can consider this info as well...
4. Use `search` as type and `hibernate` or underlying data store as subtype, method  name as action.

But the point you raised is valid. There is a way out. During the restoration, if no frontend is enabled, the revert won't be needed in the controller since it's mainly used to refresh the cache of the block device (frontend). Also, the currently logic makes replicas automatically revert to the restored snapshot, which will cause problems anyway if the controller's frontend is still up.

So we can add a few constraints to make it work:
1. If the controller's frontend is up, no restoration is allowed.
2. If a restoration is in progress for any replica, `start-frontend` of the controller is not allowed. For this purpose, replicas need to reports if it's restoring or not.

Since replicas revert to the newly restored snapshot automatically, after the restoration is completed, the frontend can be started again and the volume should contain the restored volume content.",https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-engine/pull/374#discussion_r298853332,longhorn-engine

If you think this is important to test, it should be enough to do it only in one dedicated test called `testRepeatedInvocations`. I assume the other things tested shouldn't matter with the repetition, right?

The problem is that this makes the unit tests much slower. As we accumulate tests, it is important for us to keep them as quick as possible.

298848881,mwiencek,MEMBER,2019-06-30T20:47:03Z,"My first thought was it's not intuitive how to use these options, since e.g. `(sending_timeout => 1, timeout => 3)` and `(sending_timeout => 3, timeout => 1)` would both have the same global timeout, but different ""no activity"" timeouts. Since they're added, it's not clear what `sending_timeout` measures, i.e. what will happen after 1s in the first case or 3s in the second.

Might be less confusing to just have one option for the global timeout (perhaps repurposing `timeout` for it), since these may not work as one might expect. The `LWP::UserAgent` `timeout` doesn't seem to be something we particularly need to configure separately - it aborts the request ""if no activity on the connection to the server is observed for timeout seconds,"" but we mainly just want to ensure the entire request returns within X seconds. So `LWP::UserAgent` `timeout` can just be set to the same value as the global `timeout` (or even timeout / 2 if we want to abort early).",https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-server/pull/1102#discussion_r298848881,musicbrainz-server

From the prom [go docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus#Opts):

>  // ConstLabels are used to attach fixed labels to this metric. Metrics
    // with the same fully-qualified name must have the same label names in
    // their ConstLabels.
    //
    // ConstLabels are only used rarely.

Instead, I think we want to use the labels at time of use, so that `cacheHitTotal` and `cacheMissTotal` will be available package wide, but when you use them you'll add the labels, ex:

```go
cacheHitTotal.WithLabelValues(""type"", ""flag"", ""cache"", ""memory"").Inc()
```

Then for when we add evaluation cache, it will be like:

```go
cacheHitTotal.WithLabelValues(""type"", ""evaluation"", ""cache"", ""memory"").Inc()
```

DefaultCanvas has no concept of UnitCellHeight & thus instantiates a regular metal grid with repeat = 1.  So the track number needs to be adjusted accordingly (Previously the repeat for m2 was equal to h = self.m2PerUnitCell) as shown below:
>  clg=ColoredCenterLineGrid( colors=['c2','c1'], pitch= p['M2']['Pitch'], width= p['M2']['Width'], offset= p['M2']['Offset'], repeat=self.m2PerUnitCell),

We can think of adding another input arguments for UnitCellHeight & UnitCellWidth to the DefaultCanvas as well so that it computes the repeats appropriately. Feedback would be appreciated.

- You don't need always to side-load the app to perform dyn. ana. the app might be installed already or you need to extra repackage it (for non-rooted) devices.

I am aware that some of the members of that class are protected by a `QMutex` but it is not entirely clear why those particular ones are so protected; and rather than having to read the settings from that class for every `T2DMap::paintEvent()` I felt it was safer to work from copies held in the `TMap` class and only access the *master* ones in `Host` when they needed to be changed or used to initialise the copies.,https://github.com/Mudlet/Mudlet/pull/2621#discussion_r298816853,Mudlet

Fantastico! Headers will help you highlight segments of your web page. 

So far, we've used tags that stand on their own. However, we sometimes need to specify an attribute, which is information that the tag needs to do its work. For example, to display an image, we need an `<img>` tag, but we also need a source attribute so the browser knows the location of the image. We can add an attribute as follows:

```html
<img src=""https://octodex.github.com/images/vinyltocat.png"">
```

You'll also notice that the image tag doesn't need to close since it is considered to be an [empty](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp) tag.

298826039,Darkren,COLLABORATOR,2019-06-30T09:50:40Z,"@evanlinjin hm, as I can see, we still need some kind of flag indicating that the server is done. If we do as you suggested, than `close` will return `true` only once, when it is called for the first time. But the first time it's intented to be called from `Close`. This way when we get an error from the listener and call `close`, it will be the second call which will result in `false`, thus returning the unwanted error from `Serve`. Probably we should have the bool being returned from `close` as a field in the `Server` struct, so it will give us the same value each time `close` is called. But it will ruin the thought you put into this `close`. What if we do it the following way. Let's say, we have this:
```
type Server struct {
    closeInitiated int32
    done int32
}
```

Then the `Close` will be:
```
func (s *Server) Close() (err error) {
        if atomic.LoadInt32(&s.done) == 1 {
                return erros.New(""server is already closed"")
        }

        if !atomic.CompareAndSwapInt32(&s.closeInitiated, 0, 1) {
                return errors.New(""server is already being closed"")
        }

	if err := s.lis.Close(); err != nil {
                atomic.Store(&s.done, 1)
                atomic.Store(&s.closeInitiated, 0)
		return err
	}

        atomic.Store(&s.done, 1)
        atomic.Store(&s.closeInitiated, 0)

        s.mx.Lock()
	s.conns = make(map[cipher.PubKey]*ServerConn)
        s.mx.Unlock()

	s.wg.Wait()
	return nil
}
```

Then we may have both `IsBeingClosed` and `IsClosed` like this:
```
func (s *Server) IsBeingClosed () bool {
        return atomic.LoadInt32(&s.closeInitiated) == 1
}

func (s *Server) IsClosed() bool {
        return atomic.LoadInt32(&s.done) == 1
}
```

And `Serve` will be like:
```
rawConn, err := s.lis.Accept()
if err != nil {
	if s.IsBeingClosed() || s.IsClosed() {
		return nil
	}
	
        return err
}
```

Personally, I don't like the idea of addig a lot of funcs which may not ever be needed (e.g. `IsBeingClosed`). What do you think if we won't try to represent the state of the whole server? We actually don't have such a need, I added this func only to filter out the socket error. What if we just add the `socketIsClosed bool` field to a server and set it to `true` via the `sync.Once` in `Close`? And we may totally remove `IsClosed` in this case and leave it's implementation a subject for future discussions if it ever gets really needed",https://github.com/skycoin/dmsg/pull/6#discussion_r298826039,dmsg

Yes.

I believe most Ubuntu users would have to do _something_. Possibly installing `python-tk` system-wide may be a way to solve the issue. Personally, and that's definitely a personal taste, I prefer recommending virtual-environment-based solution for that they are self-contained.

My own system-wide Python installation have tended to be short-lived, maybe because I don't use Python quite enough to remember what versions of what packages I installed for any given purpose. I like to rely on the cold efficiency of `pip install -r requirements.txt` :P Again, YMMV and I think it's you call, you're utlimately who is ensuring consitency in the documentation syles.

As far as I can see, this has no security implications yet whatsoever but maybe it is a good idea to always strip off extra bits when checksums get deserialized from the network, to ensure that they also conform to what is internally expected by the IBLT.

With functions to stuff/unstuff the individual odd-sized checksum bits from a byte array as I suggested above, this functionality could of course be outsourced into that deserialization function.

Since the smallest hard drive one can easily buy these days is hundreds of GB and sufficiently large USB flash drives are frequently given away for free, I don't expect the [5GB requirement ](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) to be a problem for the average beginning developer. I'm not saying that this is not a problem for anyone on any platform - I've had a hard time staying under a 2GB quota on a remote server I wanted to use for SciPy development - but that Anaconda serves a wide audience. Moreover, in situations where space is at a premium, these instructions are easily adapted for use with [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), which comes with `conda` but without all the other packages. I would be happy to review such a PR, or a PR for any other choice of Python distribution, package manager, virtual environment system, and editor. (The choice of all those is easy if you pick Anaconda, BTW.) At some point we can combine all these to replace the [current build documentation ](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/building/index.html) entirely, which has never worked for me without modification and (hopefully most would agree) not as easy for a first-time developer to follow as the new guides and videos.

If a package ```py-foo``` is happy with whatever version of ```py-bar```, then even if there is a newer version of ```py-bar``` available upstream we should not generate a new Portfile (or probably even update it unconditionally once that feature is available). There might be valid reason for keeping ```py-bar``` at a lower version because of requirements of other packages for example.

So I think we should check whether the available package would fulfill the ```constraints``` and if that's the case we just log ""FYI: there is a newer version available upstream"" but don't do anything else. If the version is too low then we should certainly log that and only in that case we could consider to return ```True```. But even there I would be in favor of not doing that right now as this would only work properly anyway once the ""update"" feature is in place.

One snag which I have run into is that the admin utility `yggdrasilctl` has a hardcoded expectation to either find its configuration file in `/etc/yggdrasil.conf` or a unix socket at `/var/run/yggdrasil.sock` and it looks like `DynamicUser` only lets services have write access to subdirectories of `/etc` and `/run`.  Is that correct?  If so I will have to patch `yggdrasilctl` to change its default filenames.,https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/63863#discussion_r298836982,nixpkgs

298822884,evanlinjin,MEMBER,2019-06-30T08:16:28Z,"using `sync.Once` will probably be more elegant here.

Have a `s.close() (closed bool, err error)` that closes `s.lis` once, and does `s.conns = make(map[cipher.PubKey]*ServerConn)`.

Then `Close()` will look the following (note that `wg.Wait()` is outside `once.Do()` to avoid hang):
```golang
func (s *Server) Close() error {
	closed, err := s.close()
	if !closed {
		err = errors.New(""server already closed"")
	}
	s.wg.Wait()
	return err
}
```
And error-handling within `s.Serve()`...
```golang
rawConn, err := s.lis.Accept()
if err != nil {
	if err == io.ErrUnexpectedEOF {
		continue
	}
	if closed, err := s.close(); !closed {
		return err

In this approach, when finding a new Land location, I'm adding it to an existing island if one of it's neighbours is already part of that island, and if not i'm creating a new island with only this new location.
A better approach would be to avoid iterating through all the islands every time we find a new Land location and change the isLand value to false after adding it to an island if i remember correctly and i'm not missing something.

My opinion at the moment is: when this is backported to fp-ts v2 (should happen soon), creating and handling `ReaderTaskEither`s is going to be cheaper and more intuitive (no `class` wrapping), so the Fetch name could just be dropped in favor of `ReaderTaskEither`.

Do you have any suggestions in the meantime?

Regarding:
> So the Fetch concept is not strictly related to fetching some data, but to a more general remote call

I'd say not even to the ""remote call"" part. This is probably not obvious from these docs, but a query is characterized by one or more of the 3 effects described above. E.g. we use it to access `localStorage`, which is only effectful in the sense of IO (sync) and possibly Either (validation of the contents), but definitely not ""remote""",https://github.com/buildo/avenger/pull/186#discussion_r298824120,avenger

Anyway, it feels wrong to expose this just because of how the code works. The only reason we make this check there is for cases when the query has no data source associated with it:

We can move this logic to the backend and return the appropriate error there in such cases, making this `if` unnecessary.

Most of the work done in Jonker--Volgenant is related to preprocessing and initialization -- coming up with a good partial solution before moving to shortest path searches -- but that hasn't been included in the implementation at hand (and I'm not saying I think it should be).

However, this is going to be an inherent agent plugin and we don't use either for both, we keep those empty for users to add. We add important information to the formal schema used by the APM server as well, which means we need to define new fields for that.
Can you explain a bit what is the value of these two pieces of info and give an example?

At the moment just remove those and if you really want them from the get go- use the manual API to add labels in the method itself.

Most CSP reporting tools can filter CSP reports based on content, but as this is reported as an inline code execution, location is always line 1 / character 1, so you can not differentiate between this ""legit"" violation or another violation, making the reporting quite useless.

To me, it is indeed implied, because when you republish **the same** technical report, the latest publication replaces the previous ones (which are merely kept around for archival and documentation purposes). This is where the implication is: when you republish a report, this is always with the intent of replacing (i.e. superseding) previously published versions of the same report. And there isn't really an undo or a way to grant exceptions here; if you have published a document as CR, and decide that you liked the previous WD better, you cannot undo the publication of the CR (although you can publish a new WD that replaces the CR and has the same content as the old one). Similarly, If you have published a second REC of the same technical report, you cannot ""un-supersede"" the first REC without republishing it on top of the second one. In other words, a single technical report only has one latest version, and all the non-last versions are superseded by it.",https://github.com/w3c/w3process/pull/213#discussion_r298822221,w3process

The advantage of having `--overwrite` off by default is to recover from potential minuscule regressions via terminal scrollback history, e.g. if you introduce a bug at the very end of development and aren't sure exactly what caused it. You could use your scrollback history and the good test output to try to diagnose what happened.

Initially Selenide didn't depend on commons-lang.jar. I didn't want to introduce a new dependency just because of 2 tiny methods. That's why I wrote those 2 methods by myself (`ArrayUtils.contains` and  `StringUtils.defaultString`).

Now Selenide depends on commons-lang.jar, but not directly (through BMP and HtmlUnit). Most of Selenide users automatically get commons-lang.jar, but there can be some users who exclude BMP and HtmlUnit, and they would also exclude commons-lang.jar.

298854170,github-learning-lab[bot],CONTRIBUTOR,2019-06-30T23:37:25Z,"## Step 4: Add a page title

Your web page is beginning to take shape! HTML and body tags are important, but their effect isn't too visible. Next, we'll make a visible change, by giving your page a title. Your page's title will show up on the title bar in your web browser, or as the title of any tabs you've got open. The title is used in all sorts of other places!

![a screenshot of the title on a browser tab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16547949/41006294-e990b476-68ee-11e8-8cfa-67c72c132095.png)

The title tag looks like this:

```html
<title>I am a title!</title>
```

But the title tag must be inside of a head tag. By now, you've noticed that tags have a hierarchical structure. In our prior example, the `html` tag was the parent of the `body` tag. In a similar fashion, the `head` tag will be the parent of the `title` tag, like so:

```html
<head>
    <title>I am a title!</title>
</head>
```

Finally, the `head` and `title` tags, will be children of the `html` tag, but siblings of the `body` tag.

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>I am a title!</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        Some content.
    </body>
</html>
```

### :keyboard: Activity: Give your page a title

Apply this suggested change, or follow the instructions below if you'd like to type out the code manually.

```suggestion
    <head>
        <title>My awesome web page</title>
    </head>

```

1. Click on **Files Changed**.
1. Click on the ellipsis (...) and select **Edit file**.
1. Place an opening `<head>` tag and an opening `<title>` tag after the first opening `html` tag, but before the `body` tag.
1. Write out a title after the opening `title` tag.
1. Place a closing `</title>` tag and a closing `</head>` tag after your new title, but before the `body` tag. 
1. In the _Commit changes_ section, enter a commit message that describes what you've done.
1. Ensure you've selected _Commit directly to the `add-index` branch_.
1. Click on **Commit changes**.

That means we're providing an extra way to do a thing we don't encourage in the first place. I get what you're saying about discouraging CSS usage, but if they get to the point of needing _custom_ values (which is what our `margin` prop would allow), they've got to the point of just using CSS anyway. I understand that we're providing an ""easier"" (though barely) way to style a component, but it's an easier way to do something you don't want to encourage.

From what I can tell the two _common_ scenarios are:

* use the default theme values you should be supplying with your theme
* use no margin because it's a solo icon

Anything else should be a rarity and it's fine to one-off it. Or maybe we should have multiple theme values. Overriding the defaults being discouraged is fine, but if that's the case why offer an override prop?

I should be clear: I'm talking about just the `margin` prop. For things like colour, which are pretty fundamental to an icon and are encouraged/likely to be changed by the user, it's fine to have a prop for it.",https://github.com/octopusthink/nautilus/pull/88#discussion_r298833155,nautilus

ci-common -> ci-reference
ci-common -> ci-openvdb

I'm making an assumption that we'll only care about a `zip_code` for a given version.  That is, we're probably never going to look for records for a specific `zip_code` regardless of it's `version`, right?

Great job opening a pull request @designedchen! I've gone ahead and closed your [previous issue](https://github.com/designedchen/intro-html/issues/1). 

This pull request contains some content, but it doesn't have any of the HTML structure that tells a browser how to structure the content. All pages created with HTML must contain tags that identify it as such. The tags look like this:

```html
<html>
    <body>
        The HTML content goes here.
    </body>
</html>
```

You may notice two copies of the HTML tag, and two copies of the body tag. We call these the _opening_ and _closing_ tags. Let's look at the same code, but include a little explanation.

- `<html>` is the opening HTML tag
- `<body>` is the opening body tag
- `</body>` is the closing body tag
- `</html>` is the closing HTML tag

In HTML, spacing doesn't really matter. We've added some tabs to make the code easier to see, but the web browser will ignore the extra spacing. Now that you understand the building blocks of HTML, let's add HTML to the `index.html` file in your project.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add the `html` and `body` tags to `index.html`

Apply this suggested change, or follow the instructions below if you'd like to type out the code manually.

```suggestion
<html>

  <body>
    Hello there, awesome person! 
  </body>

</html>
```

1. Click on **Files Changed** to see the newly added `index.html` file.
1. Click on the ellipsis (...) and select **Edit file**.
1. Before the existing content, add an opening `<html>` tag, and an opening `<body>` tag.
1. After the existing content, add a closing `</body>` tag, and a closing `</html>` tag.
1. In the _Commit changes_ section, enter a commit message that describes what you've done.
1. Ensure you've selected _Commit directly to the `add-index` branch_.
1. Click on **Commit changes**.

It already did used to refund if there was no data. I don't understand the relationship between data being empty and not being able to refund. This is the data from the notary, the refund function doesn't use the data anyway. Also, if we can attempt to refund when the data can't be parsed, then we can definitely attempt to refund when the data is empty because when parsing fails, we also end up with no data. I just raise a value error so I can take advantage of the refund in the try/except instead of having duplicate code just two lines above it.

298847003,redshiftzero,NONE,2019-06-30T19:49:22Z,"So there will be times where a static type checker will need additional information about the types of variables beyond the annotations in function/method argument and return types (e.g. one of the issues in `syft/grid.py` was `""error: Need type annotation for 'tag_counter'""`). If we want to be able to run mypy without errors on the codebase, there are two paths: 

* Add an annotation in variable definitions where needed such that mypy can infer the types of variables it doesn't yet understand (the approach I took in this diff), or

* Add the same type information in a comment e.g. `tag_counter = Counter()  # type: CounterType[int]`

Either is a fine solution, though the latter might be a bit more approachable for a contributor who is familiar with Python but not yet type annotations. I didn't take this path as there is [a linting check](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/blob/dev/.pre-commit-config.yaml#L21) disallowing type information in comments.

```python
    and spec.version[0] != 'flang'
```

Or, possibly cleaner but currently kind of weird looking:
```python
    and 'flang' not in spec.version.version
```

The versions are compared (mostly) the way RPM compares versions: split into a tuple on punctuation and at alpha/numeric boundaries, and compare the resulting tuples lexicographically.  Using `[]` on a `Version` gives you the components of that split.  `spec.version[0]` is the `'flang'` part you want.  `spec.version.version` gets you the tuple itself, but it's sadly not very well named... it should really be something like `'parts'` to make the second case above read better.

A larger question is why the flang versions aren't just suffixes of the LLVM base version, e.g. `3.6.0-flang-20180921`. That would make them compare properly with the other versions so we wouldn't have to special case them here.

I see your point! And I think you are correct. However, I also think that 407 is a low level status code and not very often used. So I don't like the idea of added a special exception type for this.

In tune with the music along [Darky1](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3372928)'s storyboard, the map follows the baroquian motif of vanitas through which it blooms into a thundering roar of raw emotion to then just as quickly fades away into nothingness.

I see that you probably did it to access the `insert` function, right?

You may be wondering why the `Nodes` class doesn't support insertion.
ANS: because `Nodes` is part of the API exposed to the plugins (models and graphs), and while Nodes is just a container, if we make the `insert` function available, modellers might think that this is the right way to add a node to the graph. However, only the graph should be able to add a node to itself...

So, in the case of the `m_selectedNodes` member, it should be defined as a simple `std::vector<Node>`

[This is the part of luarocks that checks for include headers](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/blob/3e12f3df50e4f6f0035f13b255d380fbf207a7c1/configure#L429).

In either case, table growth is guaranteed to fail if attempting to grow past the declared maximum. As with linear memory, when a maximum is declared, implementations should (non-normative) attempt to reserve virtual memory up to the maximum size. While failure to allocate the initial memory size is a runtime error, failure to reserve up to the maximum is not. When a maximum memory size is not declared, on architectures with limited virtual address space, engines should allocate only the initial size and reallocate on demand.

I tried to look for an explanation but couldn't find much except [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2336940/4804277) but newer versions of Postgres claim to have a very fast `LIKE`, so I don't know how much of it is relevant.

Irrespective of the above, matching fields like statuses should be exact anyway in my opinion. In this case, an appropriate value to be searched in the database could be tied to the ""All Failed Builds"". I need to think a little more on how we can implement it.

Speaking of which, boy, ohh boy is it hard. Insanely hard. You might expect ""pp map"" when you look at it's BPM and Star Rating, but let me tell you: this is anything but ordinary. The way 1/6 patterns are arranged will keep your fingers dancing constantly during the intense parts, as do the streams, which also feature a mix of longer 1/6 bursts; up to 13 notes in a row, which is not easy to keep up with at 200 BPM, especially with their rather unusual colouring! Also, the Slider Velocity manipulation will demand your eyes to adjust quickly as it gets increasingly faster along with the song's intensity, befitting it perfectly!

Actually, assuming the year has 4 digits, if one counts the charactors, it's 29 of them. Plus the teminating '\0', 30 should be enough.
However, the compiler thinks the year might beyond 4 digits. I've given 2 extra bytes in the fix. In theory, it's still not enough. However, the compiler doesn't complain any more and we'll probably not see the year which can overflow. :-)
Another observation is that the compiler option ""-Os"" plays a role here as well. I've tried a standalone test cpp and use the compiler option coming from ""cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo"". I can repro the issue. However, when I remove the ""-Os"" option, the warning disappears.

Anyway, having the extra 2 bytes on the stack is harmless and solves my problem.",https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/15023#discussion_r298844838,mapbox-gl-native

298840382,ralf0131,CONTRIBUTOR,2019-06-30T16:06:52Z,"Hi, 

I did some local test, the proposed pull request could not work correctly. If you start two provider and a consumer, you can see that cpu usage is not being sent from provider to consumer.

I agree with @guohao that, we need to call the CpuUsageService remotely to add listener rather that `new` directly, and if there are multiple providers, we have to call the addListener method for each provider. 

The problem is the StatisticsLoadBalance is a bean managed by Spring, so it is impossible to get the provider ip addresses when initializing StatisticsLoadBalance class. So we have to delay the call the addListener to the `doSelect` method.

To obtain a proxy for remote service, you may checkout `org.apache.dubbo.monitor.dubbo.DubboMonitorFactory#createMonitor`, there are some example code.

Since it is lazy to obtain the cpu usage, the load balance may not working very well during the initial period of time (lack of cpu usage stat), so there should be some fall back strategies, once the cpu stat are collected, the stat based load balance can be activated.",https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/4195#discussion_r298840382,dubbo

I just pushed several updates to the RFC to address this.

I flipped the recommendation around. It now leaves the `&` background operator behavior as is, which matches the default `Start-Job` behavior, and proposes `&!` be used when you want to see output (or the corresponding `Start-Job -ShowOutput` parameter.

I changed `-ShowInHost` to `ShowOutput`, and renamed `Show-/Hide-JobData` as `Show-/Hide-JobOutput` so that they are all consistent. I prefer `Output` as the suffix over `Progress` because this isn't the same as `Write-Progress`, and I don't want to confuse the two. I prefer `Output` as the suffix over `Status` because job status is a different thing.

I believe making this consistent on `Output` will set expectations appropriately and avoid confusion. If you disagree, please let me know.

For that I would be using another strategy.
Let's say you want to click an element, and hereby we could see the `li` element crossed line.

All we need for that is the element, once we have it we have it's functionality `element.classList.toggle('done');`.
in this Component you have an `id` definition on line 11, using numeric id's, that make it a quite strange for me.
then you are getting it on line 14 with `.getElementById(id)` and it's fine for simplicity sake, but we need simpler.

what about a one function can control both `StaticList` and the `DynaimcList` with no `isStatic` or `markAsCompleted` prop?

Alas, that does not really reproduce the initial problem. It doesn't even hit the same code path (if we imitate the implementation in OpenJDK 8). The initial problem was to lookup a user/group name for a UID/GID, respectively. For that matter we would need to exercise the `getUsername` and `getGroupName` methods which are only called if the `NativeUserPrincipal`'s `name` is `None`.

Great job opening a pull request @designedchen! I've gone ahead and closed your [previous issue](https://github.com/designedchen/intro-html/issues/1). 

This pull request contains some content, but it doesn't have any of the HTML structure that tells a browser how to structure the content. All pages created with HTML must contain tags that identify it as such. The tags look like this:

```html
<html>
    <body>
        The HTML content goes here.
    </body>
</html>
```

You may notice two copies of the HTML tag, and two copies of the body tag. We call these the _opening_ and _closing_ tags. Let's look at the same code, but include a little explanation.

- `<html>` is the opening HTML tag
- `<body>` is the opening body tag
- `</body>` is the closing body tag
- `</html>` is the closing HTML tag

In HTML, spacing doesn't really matter. We've added some tabs to make the code easier to see, but the web browser will ignore the extra spacing. Now that you understand the building blocks of HTML, let's add HTML to the `index.html` file in your project.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add the `html` and `body` tags to `index.html`

Apply this suggested change, or follow the instructions below if you'd like to type out the code manually.

```suggestion
<html>

  <body>
    Hello there, awesome person! 
  </body>

</html>
```

1. Click on **Files Changed** to see the newly added `index.html` file.
1. Click on the ellipsis (...) and select **Edit file**.
1. Before the existing content, add an opening `<html>` tag, and an opening `<body>` tag.
1. After the existing content, add a closing `</body>` tag, and a closing `</html>` tag.
1. In the _Commit changes_ section, enter a commit message that describes what you've done.
1. Ensure you've selected _Commit directly to the `add-index` branch_.
1. Click on **Commit changes**.

‚úÖ Check
‚úÖ That
‚úÖ Off your list!

Great job with lists. Let's try adding some links, shall we?

### About hyperlinks

Hyperlinks allow people to navigate through pages on the web. Links are achieved with the anchor tag, `<a>`, and have two major components: the location they link to, and the content that should be linked. The location of the link is specified as a `href` attribute, and the content that should be linked can be specified between the opening and closing tags, like this:


      ```html
      <li><a href=""https://github.com"">This is a link to GitHub!</a></li>
      ```


### :keyboard: Activity: Create links to your favorite sites

Apply this suggested change, or follow the instructions below if you'd like to type out the code manually. Please note that the suggested change may not be in the proper place for your list, so make sure it is inside of a set of `<ol>` or `<ul>` tags.

```suggestion
      <li>My favorite site is <a href=""https://github.com"">GitHub</a>!</li>
```

1. Click on **Files Changed**.
1. Click on the ellipsis (...) and select **Edit file**.
1. In the list you just created, add a link to each of your favorite sites to their respective URLs. You can do this by adding an opening anchor tag `<a>` tag with `href` attribute with your favorite site's URL, the name of the site inside the anchor tag, and a closing anchor `</a>` tag. Here is an example of a list item with a link:

298838620,wwylele,MEMBER,2019-06-30T15:11:33Z,"In my theory that tool still needs to obey the same rule: it can't just expand the .text/.rodata/.data section, otherwise it has to move the section following it. The only section it can expand is .bss, where it place the code and reprotect the .bss to executable. Skimming over their code, it seems it indeed does it in this way. .bss section is not stored in .code, and [it is automatically expanded according to exheader](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/blob/0c6c1d49d7e62d486bf88f800bb4d24eb00afbd2/src/core/loader/ncch.cpp#L94), therefore there is no need to expand the size here.

The reason I am particular concerned at this part is it adds extra logic that 3DS doesn't have, and it can be something we would forget to change if we change some related thing in the future. One that comes into my mind is FIRM module loading, which has a very different code section size calculation rule (they apply additional alignment/padding between sections). If we include this code here, and we want to change FIRM module loading in the future, we would have to change two separate places to make this work.",https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/pull/4813#discussion_r298838620,citra

There's also a ""shortcut"" to actually fetch the PR given its number:
```sh
git fetch origin pull/<#>/head:<local_branch_name
```
For instance for yours:
```
git fetch upstream pull/1901/head:feature-docs-test-pr
remote: Enumerating objects: 6, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (6/6), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 6 (delta 4), reused 6 (delta 4), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (6/6), done.
From https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android
 * [new ref]           refs/pull/1901/head -> feature-docs-test-pr
[git checkout feature-docs-test-pr
Switched to branch 'feature-docs-test-pr'
```
The workflow I personally use most of the time is to add the remote and checkout the branch. So for yours:
```sh
git remote add opacam https://github.com/opacam/python-for-android.git
git fetch opacam
git checkout opacam/feature-docs-test-pr

It's already in `CMAKE_ARGS`, user can specify custom `DEPENDS_ON_PACKAGES` without `x264`. But probably it will affect `PACKAGE_UNRELOCATABLE_TEXT_FILES` so it will not work in practice.

Capturing the essence of a song can be considered a herculean feat for a mapper. This map gets the job done.

In tune with the music along [Darky1](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3372928)'s storyboard, the map follows the baroque-an motif of vanitas through which it blooms into a thundering roar of raw emotion to then just as quickly fade away into nothingness.

298815934,michaelbynum,CONTRIBUTOR,2019-06-30T02:18:00Z,"If the expression were ```(m.x + m.y)**2```, then the 3rd and 4th order terms would be zero. As written, this is a 4th order polynomial. Thus, the 4th order taylor series expansion should be exact, which is essentially what this test checks. In fact, that is what all of these tests are doing. This is why I focused on testing polynomials. With polynomials, we can test that a taylor series of the same order as the polynomial returns the same polynomial. It is not terribly easy to test that the expressions generated are exactly what I expect without writing a custom walker. However, it is very unlikely that the value of the original expression and the value of the taylor series expansion will be identical at all of the points being tested unless the expressions are identical. In my opinion, that makes these very good tests.

Keep in mind that, in the current implemenation, the higher order taylor series expansions of multivariate expressions are very ugly. This is because the implementation is rather naive, and no simplification is done. For example, the 4th order taylor series expansion for 

```(m.x*m.y)**2``` 

is 

```2.25*(x - 0.5) + 0.75*(y - 1.5) + 0.5625 + 0.5*(x - 0.5)*(4.5*(x - 0.5) + 3.0*(y - 1.5)) + 0.5*(y - 1.5)*(3.0*(x - 0.5) + 0.5*(y - 1.5)) + 0.16666666666666666*(x - 0.5)*(x - 0.5)*(6.0*(y - 1.5)) + 0.16666666666666666*(x - 0.5)*(y - 1.5)*(6.0*(x - 0.5) + 2.0*(y - 1.5)) + 0.16666666666666666*(y - 1.5)*(x - 0.5)*(6.0*(x - 0.5) + 2.0*(y - 1.5)) + 0.16666666666666666*(y - 1.5)*(y - 1.5)*(2.0*(x - 0.5)) + 0.041666666666666664*(x - 0.5)*(x - 0.5)*(y - 1.5)*(4*(y - 1.5)) + 0.041666666666666664*(x - 0.5)*(y - 1.5)*(x - 0.5)*(4*(y - 1.5)) + 0.041666666666666664*(x - 0.5)*(y - 1.5)*(y - 1.5)*(4*(x - 0.5)) + 0.041666666666666664*(y - 1.5)*(x - 0.5)*(x - 0.5)*(4*(y - 1.5)) + 0.041666666666666664*(y - 1.5)*(x - 0.5)*(y - 1.5)*(4*(x - 0.5)) + 0.041666666666666664*(y - 1.5)*(y - 1.5)*(x - 0.5)*(4*(x - 0.5))```

- As fun√ß√µes `sin` e `cos` do `math.h` usam n√∫meros do tipo `double` tanto como argumentos quanto como valor de retorno, mas os n√∫meros que n√≥s usamos no jogo s√£o todos `float` (ex: `Jog.pos`, `Jog.rot`, `Atk`, `dis`, etc). 

  Esse c√≥digo funciona porque ele faz convers√£o impl√≠cita entre `float` e `double`. Mas isso n√£o √© ideal, porque √© mais lento e pode resultar em imprecis√µes. O ideal seria usar as fun√ß√µes `sinf` e `cosf` tamb√©m do `math.h`, que fazem a mesma coisa por√©m com `float`s.

298848397,Matt-Weiss,NONE,2019-06-30T20:30:15Z,"In my experience so far the trick is that you're getting ""Promises all the way down."" So you need to do returns all the way back up. For example, my getWeather looks like this.
```
var get_weather = function(location){
  return axios.get(`https://api.darksky.net/forecast/${process.env.DARK_SKY_API_KEY}/${location}`)
  .then(response => {
    return response.data;
  })
```
Notice the return on the response.data *and* on the axios.get

Additionally, even when you get the return all the way to the top like that, when you call it in your route, it will still return a promise. You need another .then to retrieve the value, like so.

```
if (req.body.api_key){
    verifyApiKey(req.body.api_key)
    .then((validity) => {
      if (validity == false) {
        res.setHeader(""Content-Type"", ""application/json"");
        res.status(401).send(""No user with that key!"")
      } else {
        get_location(req.query.location)
        .then(location => {
          var parsed_location = `${location[""lat""]},${location[""lng""]}`
          return get_weather(parsed_location)
          .then(weather => {
            final_forecast = parseWeather(req.query.location, weather)
            res.setHeader(""Content-Type"", ""application/json"");
            res.status(200).send(JSON.stringify(final_forecast));
          })
          .catch(error => {
            return error;
          });
```
Every single helper I wrote here still needed a .then in the router to retrieve and work with the returns I expected.

I got this from the [docs](http://api.getakka.net/docs/stable/html/120DDADF.htm):
""This special ActorRef is exclusively for use during unit testing in a single-threaded environment. Therefore, it overrides the dispatcher to CallingThreadDispatcher and sets the receiveTimeout to None. Otherwise, it acts just like a normal ActorRef. You may retrieve a reference to the underlying actor to test internal logic. A TestActorRef< TActor> can be implicitly casted to an IActorRef or you can get the actual IActorRef from the Ref property.""

I believe another alternative would be to use dependency injection. Somehow we must be able to test these classes and mock their behavior using Akka system. I'm not an expert in Akka, so I just did what was ""suggested"".

Reading endpoints (index, show) though will often be different as the API has a narrow focus while the UI may display many different things at once.

To answer your first question, you can use resource nesting:

```elixir
resources ""/networks"", NetworkController do
  resources ""/collaboration"", CollaborationController, only: [:create, :delete]
end

resources ""/podcasts"", NetworkController do
  resources ""/collaboration"", CollaborationController, only: [:create, :delete]
end

# ...
```

That generates routes like `DELETE  /networks/:network_id/collaborations/:id`

In that case you can have one generic `CollaborationController` and match on the params, as one will have a `network_id` in the request and the other one `podcast_id`. etc. `mix phx.routes` is helpful to see what routes witch what paramters are generated.",https://github.com/podlove/radiator/pull/142#discussion_r298834760,radiator

298852339,Eric-Arellano,CONTRIBUTOR,2019-06-30T22:42:48Z,"We can use here a utility we have to identify missing `__init__.py` files: 

https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/c26f374caadc91de631a98ff540854ff923d2a2d/src/python/pants/backend/python/subsystems/pex_build_util.py#L79-L92

The function works like this:
```
$ ./pants repl src/python/pants/backend/python/subsystems

>>> from pants.backend.python.subsystems.pex_build_util import identify_missing_init_files
>>> identify_missing_init_files([""hello/world/test.py""])
{'hello/__init__.py', 'hello/world/__init__.py'}
```

So, here you would call  `identify_missing_init_files([target_workdir])`, then iterate over the result to create an empty `__init__.py` file.

--

In addition to the above change, it would be great to use `pathlib.Path` to simplify the creation of the file. Specifically, you could do this:

```python
for missing_init in identify_missing_init_files([target_workdir]):
  Path(missing_init).touch()
```

However, some of your uses of this have long bodies to make the requests, like in `loadFilesOnLoaders`, which makes this current API seem nicer.

Hmmm, I'm not sure I fully agree with this statement to be honest. Exercism has always structured the exercises in typical TDD fashion, where each new test case is intended to ""break"" the existing code, and require changes to the code to make it pass. The TDD mindset is that you should do the minimal amount of work to make the code pass; it is up to the tests to force an extensive implementation that covers all cases.

That being said, I do feel that you have a very valid point, where we shouldn't discourage a student from using valid defensive coding practices. I like your suggestion (especially the bit about considering the difference in behavior). The only thing I would maybe change is the ""For variety"" bit.

d.d_name is a byte string. So in python3 you'll have to explicitly decode it to convert it to a string. Otherwise, I see this in the mgr log after adding some debugging, where `.` and `..` also get registered to be purged.

We cross our fingers and hope the library is somewhere in the RPATH chain, or in LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH (the former doesn't work with RUNPATH, the latter mixes up install and build dirs).

Having said that, it makes sense to put the configuration of shared library dependencies as an optional argument to `ADD_GUILE_MODULE`. And would simplify updating downstream projects.

As you've identified it's causing errors in the check, but also since the point of check mode is to check if a change would be made we really do need to call the real get_identity_dkim_attributes even if check mode is enabled.

So I'd suggest switching this back to caling get_identity_dkim attribute regardless of check_mode. The check_mode can be better handled in the main method, see comment below.",https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/53637#discussion_r298825725,ansible

298849325,blueelvis,CONTRIBUTOR,2019-06-30T21:01:02Z,"I agree with you that the most ideal way would be to let the caller handle it. But, before I pushed this commit, I tried to do that and it became pretty messy. Adding loads of `if` conditions didn't make sense when ideally we should be exiting immediately if we are not able to parse the size. It seems to be better for the function itself to exit rather than the chance of caller not handling it properly deep in the code.

This utility function needs to be called every time when we need to parse any memory or disk size. Be it the defaults or input by the user. Do you think it is still adding a lot of `if` conditions to check for errors everywhere rather than having the function exit immediately?

Following are the 6 constructs as of now which need to be parsed everywhere -
1. DefaultMemorySize
2. MinimumMemorySize
3. DefaultDiskSize
4. MinimumDiskSize

Let me disregard the fact that this is a user-bot only feature for a minute.

In this library whenever you want to edit something about the model you don't use any `set_` methods, you have an `edit` method with a kwarg-only interface. Now, `User.edit` doesn't make much sense to add for only this thing but it's what would be the most consistent. The problem is that the concept of editing a `User` instance and adding an `edit` to it is that it breaks expectations when using `Member.edit`. Why couldn't you edit the note on a Member with the same interface?

Destroying contexts is needed mostly if you're doing a proper API that allows you to control the lifetime of the library or use it in multiple parts of your application independently and without leaks (ie plugins or modules that don't know about each other).

threadvar comes with its own problems including the point / time of initialization, and no (easy) way to coordinate release - what happens if you want to pass an decimal between threads?

are mpc contexts re-entrant/thread safe? many contexts are (because they contain only read-only stuff), in that case you don't need on per thread - I'd check the upstream docs here.

```
In previous versions of Dojo, virtual DOM nodes created by widgets get decorated with 
additional metadata such as `bind`. These extra properties were never meant to get 
exposed to the end user. However, as this metadata gets added by mutating the 
`DNodes`, they were inadvertently exposed. As of Dojo version 6, we no longer mutate 
`DNodes` to ensure that this implementation detail of the framework is not exposed to 
the end user.

But we'd be providing it for the purpose of allowing users to create their own features, rather than just exposing internal details purely for access by the test suite.

User-created features are useful for at least two categories of things:

* general purpose features which xapian-letor doesn't yet implement but would be candidates for merging into a future version.  It's useful (but not vital) to be able to implement these without having to patch and rebuild xapian-letor.  In some cases these would ideally need access to more stats so would need changes to xapian-letor anyway (e.g. if I wanted to add a feature which used the number of unique terms in the document).

* features which are specific to a particular application - for example if I'm implementing letor for search in an online store I might want to try adding features for price, number of sales, physical size of item, etc.

Many of the second category of features could actually be implemented without access to the stats (they'd probably either pull data from value slots in the Xapian DB or by querying some external data store).",https://github.com/xapian/xapian/pull/246#discussion_r298852177,xapian

Seeing my forked python-for-android files, I have an directory that we don't have committed `python_for_android.egg-info` (because at some point I installed p4a from my fork and the `egg folder` was generated... I never took care to delete that folder)...that folder seems that is the key, because it contains the `entrypoints.txt` ...the mentioned `apk` is in there...If I remove this file I got the exact error I mentioned before...

So i think that we just found another test method without install...I will try to write this one...

298827833,github-learning-lab[bot],NONE,2019-06-30T10:45:43Z,"## Step 3: Add HTML document structure

Great job opening a pull request @gettrrdun! I've gone ahead and closed your [previous issue](https://github.com/gettrrdun/intro-html/issues/1). 

This pull request contains some content, but it doesn't have any of the HTML structure that tells a browser how to structure the content. All pages created with HTML must contain tags that identify it as such. The tags look like this:

```html
<html>
    <body>
        The HTML content goes here.
    </body>
</html>
```

You may notice two copies of the HTML tag, and two copies of the body tag. We call these the _opening_ and _closing_ tags. Let's look at the same code, but include a little explanation.

- `<html>` is the opening HTML tag
- `<body>` is the opening body tag
- `</body>` is the closing body tag
- `</html>` is the closing HTML tag

In HTML, spacing doesn't really matter. We've added some tabs to make the code easier to see, but the web browser will ignore the extra spacing. Now that you understand the building blocks of HTML, let's add HTML to the `index.html` file in your project.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add the `html` and `body` tags to `index.html`

Apply this suggested change, or follow the instructions below if you'd like to type out the code manually.

```suggestion
<html>

  <body>
    Hello there, awesome person! 
  </body>

</html>
```

1. Click on **Files Changed** to see the newly added `index.html` file.
1. Click on the ellipsis (...) and select **Edit file**.
1. Before the existing content, add an opening `<html>` tag, and an opening `<body>` tag.
1. After the existing content, add a closing `</body>` tag, and a closing `</html>` tag.
1. In the _Commit changes_ section, enter a commit message that describes what you've done.
1. Ensure you've selected _Commit directly to the `add-index` branch_.
1. Click on **Commit changes**.

We could add a new generic class to the wrapper of the content, such as `form_content` which would be generic (AFAIS we could wrap [this block](https://github.com/OCA/website-cms/blob/11.0/cms_form/templates/form.xml#L156-L164) into `div.form_content`).

Then add a selector into `data-form-content-selector="".form_content""` or similar attribute inside the json info on the form elem, so that we can easily reuse the same logic to replace the content of any kind of form on the fly (eg: edit form submit w/ errors).

Hmm, I'm not sure if checking `doc->real_path` for `NULL` is sufficient, there might be more cases when we want to trigger the config save. Also, the `doc->real_path` check would have to differentiate cases like renaming and closing documents.
The config save process is pretty lightweight and, as said initially, very fast.
Users trying to reduce disk IO still can disable this feature.

Can we agree to implement more sophisticated checks independent of this PR afterwards if someone wants to?

The <normalmap> node is a math node that allows for a normal vector defined in one space to be transformed into another space. Inputs:
- ""in"" : input normal vector
- ""space"" : the input space for the normal. Possible options are ""object"" for object space and ""tangent"" for tangent space.
- ""scale"" : the normal can be scaled (offset) by a given multiplier.
- ""normal"" and ""tangent"". Two vectors from which a bitangent vector is computed to form the basis used for transformation. By default the vectors are in world space, meaning the output vector will be in world space.
```
  <nodedef name=""ND_normalmap"" node=""normalmap"" type=""vector3"" nodegroup=""math"">
    <input name=""in"" type=""vector3"" value=""0.5, 0.5, 1.0""/>

    <input name=""normal"" type=""vector3"" defaultgeomprop=""Nworld""/>
    <input name=""tangent"" type=""vector3"" defaultgeomprop=""Tworld""/>
  </nodedef>

Below is an example of this utility being used to read in a image containing tangent space normals and outputting world space normals scaled by a factor of 1.5.

298854640,github-learning-lab[bot],NONE,2019-06-30T23:48:13Z,"## Step 4: Add a page title

Your web page is beginning to take shape! HTML and body tags are important, but their effect isn't too visible. Next, we'll make a visible change, by giving your page a title. Your page's title will show up on the title bar in your web browser, or as the title of any tabs you've got open. The title is used in all sorts of other places!

![a screenshot of the title on a browser tab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16547949/41006294-e990b476-68ee-11e8-8cfa-67c72c132095.png)

The title tag looks like this:

```html
<title>I am a title!</title>
```

But the title tag must be inside of a head tag. By now, you've noticed that tags have a hierarchical structure. In our prior example, the `html` tag was the parent of the `body` tag. In a similar fashion, the `head` tag will be the parent of the `title` tag, like so:

```html
<head>
    <title>I am a title!</title>
</head>
```

Finally, the `head` and `title` tags, will be children of the `html` tag, but siblings of the `body` tag.

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>I am a title!</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        Some content.
    </body>
</html>
```

### :keyboard: Activity: Give your page a title

Apply this suggested change, or follow the instructions below if you'd like to type out the code manually.

```suggestion
    <head>
        <title>My awesome web page</title>
    </head>

```

1. Click on **Files Changed**.
1. Click on the ellipsis (...) and select **Edit file**.
1. Place an opening `<head>` tag and an opening `<title>` tag after the first opening `html` tag, but before the `body` tag.
1. Write out a title after the opening `title` tag.
1. Place a closing `</title>` tag and a closing `</head>` tag after your new title, but before the `body` tag. 
1. In the _Commit changes_ section, enter a commit message that describes what you've done.
1. Ensure you've selected _Commit directly to the `add-index` branch_.
1. Click on **Commit changes**.

It seems that `identify_missing_init_files` would not work in this case because:

1. It skips any source that's not a Python file, so passing `[target_workdir]` would not work
2. I don't know the filenames of the generated files in advance. I would have to scan the output directory to find them and then pass their names to `identify_missing_init_files`

Subject: [PATCH] repo-settings: explicitly make flags using char as signed

used as a three state boolean and therefore could also be set/compared
with -1, which will break in architectures that use unsigned char by
default (ex: ARM)

Both sides are some continuous reparameterization of the function defined on [0, 3] by f, then g, then h, and whatever those reparameterizations [0, 1] -> [0, 3] are, you can linearly interpolate between them to define a homotopy which is constant at the endpoints. I'm not sure how easy it is to express that to Lean though (and this is the point where I gave up on this kind of approach when I tried this).

Same comments, but doable for sure, apply to `comp_id` and `comp_inv`. And even for definitions like `symm`, maybe it's better to define them in terms of what I called `congr_right` (or possibly `congr_left`, Scott has caused me to lose all sense of direction). If you have access to Switzer's book Algebraic Topology I think this stuff is explained properly in Chapter 2 there--all these basic constructions are induced by structure on the unit interval (or more generally, on a cylinder functor, as in https://github.com/rwbarton/lean-homotopy-theory/blob/lean-3.4.2/src/homotopy_theory/formal/cylinder/definitions.lean).",https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/1160#discussion_r298855031,mathlib

After some research, realised a better way to handle this. Source : https://redux.js.org/recipes/structuring-reducers/immutable-update-patterns

You can do away with the `deepcopy`. Simply do:
```
    case EVAL_TESTCASE_FAILURE:
      return {
        ...state,
        [location]: {
          ...state[location],
          editorTestcases: state[location].editorTestcases.map((testcase: ITestcase, i: number) => {
            if (i === action.payload.index) {
              return {
                ...testcase,
                result : action.payload.value
              }
            }
            return testcase;
          })

At the end I don't know what exactly is happening either, I'm just facing the problem, where one of the proxies generated by PHP-DI using this library throws inside a `__destruct` method because the instance of the class the proxy is for is null inside the proxy class. Yes confusing and strange.

It's doing the job but it's not the very correct way, this is a very small application and it will not make any kind of affect here, but you will see the affect of that in a future applications.

Line 99 is just changing the state, but more accurately it's been changed before that.
Usually `setState` made for controlling the state in the correct order, so it made it's call and there is a complete lifecycle behind that call, it's not true it's only for rendering!

it have a lot happening behind, in a future lectures of course.
But just let's have our attention on line 98 which is changing the state, if you tried the following it will tell you that this line is changing it:
```javascript
    // if the first log is `true` the other `false` and this behavior tell it's been changed
    console.log(this.state.dynamicList[index].done)
    // this line is changing by reference not by value, which make the 
    updateState.done = !updateState.done;change on the stat by it self
    console.log(this.state.dynamicList[index])
```

perhaps this we will need to try changing the state in a more dynamic way, or keeping it immutable per say, so we could try:
```javascript
const updateState = this.state.dynamicList.map((item) => {
  if (item.id === this.state.dynamicList[index].id) {
    return {
      ...item, done: !item.done
    }
  } else {
    return item
  }
})
```

This is the solution for this thing, I have solved it, because it's a bit tricky and it will be removed either ways.

298831564,Akuli,OWNER,2019-06-30T12:20:02Z,"Sort is a good idea, and I have seen tkinter users who have wanted it in tkinter.

This code feels wrong to me for a couple reasons:

- You are modifying `self.rows` in a loop that loops over `self.rows`. That is generally a bad idea. For example, what does this code print?

    ```
    stuff = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
    for thing in stuff:
        stuff.remove(thing)
    print(stuff)
    ```

    The problem is that Python uses an index variable for looping internally, so it does `stuff.remove(stuff[0])`, `stuff.remove(stuff[1])` etc until `stuff[the index]` gives `IndexError`. The list shrinks as items are removed from it, which screws up the indexes; first this removes `a` (element 0), and then because the list is `['b', 'c', 'd', 'e']` it removes `'c'` (element 1), and then the list is `['b', 'd', 'e']` and it removes `'e'` (element 2). A simple solution is to loop over `stuff.copy()`.

- There is a similar issue with `self.rows.move`. Once an element has been moved, its index may still change as other items are moved. For example, if the rows are `[A, B, C]` after moving row `B` to index 1, and row `A` is moved to index 2, then `B` will be at index 0.

Here is a simpler example code that does not sort a list correctly:

```python3
import random

stuff = [7, 3, 2, 5, 6, 1, 8, 4]

def move(old, new):
    value = stuff[old]
    del stuff[old]
    stuff.insert(new, value)

sorted_stuff = sorted(stuff)
for old, value in enumerate(stuff):
    move(old, sorted_stuff.index(value))

print(stuff)
```

I would try something like this

```python3
for row in reversed(sorted_rows):
    self.rows.move(self.rows.index(row), 0)
```

This moves each item to the beginning, moving all the previously moved items after it. This is not ideal either, and it will create a *lot* of moves. There is probably a better way to do this, but at least the `move` method should be implemented with Tk's `move` command (search for `pathname move` in ttk_treeview manual page).

For example:
- When setting, make it a blocking call until the quickest store has a value, then return with the function but keep setting to the other store in the background, and call a given callback function (or notify me via given channel) when an error occurs in the background goroutine.
- When setting, block all calls and only return when all are finished
- When getting, I only want the fastest answer, cancel all other operations (we might need to introduce a context object for this)
- When getting and using 3 stores, wait for all operations, then compare their values and return an error if one of them is different
- When getting and using 3 stores, wait for all operations, then compare their values and return an error if _the majority_ of them is different. If the majority is the same then ""trust"" this majority and call `Set` in the background to the minority of Stores with ""wrong"" values and overwrite them with the ""correct"" ones
- ...

Regarding 407: It is an *HTTP* error certainly, but it is *not* an exceptional state of the calling REST application. The application cannot know that the server expects authentication, so it sends the request. The server answers 407, so the application knows *now* that it needs to ask the user for credentials, and will request a second time. This is more like a *login handshake* than handling an actual *programming error*. Hence, no need for an *exception*, but possibly a need for some kind of new API (like a callback asking for credentials).",https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxrs-api/pull/774#discussion_r298831485,jaxrs-api

> Would the auth team be willing to discuss such a feature for future releases?

Adding support for ingresses would not be too hard.

I would want general agreement from the OpenShift architects and the networking edge team that supporting ingresses is a desired approach.  Effectively no one uses ingresses in OpenShift and no one has requested ingress support in the past.  Perhaps routes should be enhanced to support non 80/443 traffic?",https://github.com/noobaa/noobaa-core/pull/5561#discussion_r298850266,noobaa-core

So that you don't need credentials, but you can use existing tokens and caches for testing. So yes, it works like this by design.

So as I said, the global_settings.json and credentials.json could move out of userdata/, but everything else in there is there on purpose. And only the stuff that is checked into the repository is there from the start and expected to be present (in whatever form). If you delete it, you can restore it using `git checkout test/userdata/addon_settings.json`.

In one of your later comments you state that it is enough to test that the delegation happens to `comparables` (and `objects`, I assume). There are already tests which verify that the default comparator is `ChronoLocalDateTimeComparator` (`LocalDateTimeAssert_defaultComparator_Test`), and though the comparator is used in this assertion, it is not possible to use objects with type other than `LocalDateTime` as parameter, so the comparator is not utilized to its full extent.

What is your opinion about accepting `Object` as parameter (so API does not break) and delegating to `comparables` only if the expected value is instance of `ChronoLocalDateTime` (or `LocalDateTime`) and to `objects` otherwise?
Ofc, using `ChronoLocalDateTime` would break symmetry since there is no `ChronoLocalDateTimeAssert` currently, i.e.
```
LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();
ChronoLocalDateTime<JapaneseDate> inJapanese = JapaneseChronology.INSTANCE.localDateTime(now);
assertThat(now).isEqualTo(inJapanese); // succeed
assertThat(inJapanese).isEqualTo(now); // fails

298819497,github-learning-lab[bot],NONE,2019-06-30T06:21:26Z,"## Step 4: Add a page title

Your web page is beginning to take shape! HTML and body tags are important, but their effect isn't too visible. Next, we'll make a visible change, by giving your page a title. Your page's title will show up on the title bar in your web browser, or as the title of any tabs you've got open. The title is used in all sorts of other places!

![a screenshot of the title on a browser tab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16547949/41006294-e990b476-68ee-11e8-8cfa-67c72c132095.png)

The title tag looks like this:

```html
<title>I am a title!</title>
```

But the title tag must be inside of a head tag. By now, you've noticed that tags have a hierarchical structure. In our prior example, the `html` tag was the parent of the `body` tag. In a similar fashion, the `head` tag will be the parent of the `title` tag, like so:

```html
<head>
    <title>I am a title!</title>
</head>
```

Finally, the `head` and `title` tags, will be children of the `html` tag, but siblings of the `body` tag.

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>I am a title!</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        Some content.
    </body>
</html>
```

### :keyboard: Activity: Give your page a title

Apply this suggested change, or follow the instructions below if you'd like to type out the code manually.

```suggestion
    <head>
        <title>My awesome web page</title>
    </head>

```

1. Click on **Files Changed**.
1. Click on the ellipsis (...) and select **Edit file**.
1. Place an opening `<head>` tag and an opening `<title>` tag after the first opening `html` tag, but before the `body` tag.
1. Write out a title after the opening `title` tag.
1. Place a closing `</title>` tag and a closing `</head>` tag after your new title, but before the `body` tag. 
1. In the _Commit changes_ section, enter a commit message that describes what you've done.
1. Ensure you've selected _Commit directly to the `add-index` branch_.
1. Click on **Commit changes**.

I'd really like to try and hide that as much as possible from users - 
it's just confusing. (though sometimes we can't)

It depends what else the alias includes, if it also includes 
-i/-k/-r/--signoff then it wont have been dying but will if we start 
requiring --exec and they don't set that.

Turns out that even though we are compiling with `-std=c++14` the XCode version of clang is simply emitting `warning: constexpr if is a C++17 extension [-Wc++17-extensions]`.

Our project runs on a linux distro that only has gcc 6.3 and `if constexpr` was added in 7 so that got me concerned. However I don't think it is a problem since `if constexpr` is evaluated at compile time and the invalid branches are always removed if it is used within a template. Therefore there is no new code that it would have to reference the gcc lib.

I think the same will be true for structured bindings since it is just syntactic sugar rather than any actual new logic. You may not need to add a work around for my case.",https://github.com/stlab/libraries/pull/268#discussion_r298825894,libraries

[sammish](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4415076) manages to make 17 minutes feel like 5 in his map of Tennyson's ""Uh Oh! EP"". The hard work he puts into expressing each song's personality shows ‚Äî and obviously pays off. The map feels smooth to play all the way through and aligns very closely to Tennyson's unique, funky style of music. This is a phenomenal debut of both sammish and Tennyson in the ranked section and we hope to see more from both in the future!

298841497,ehuss,CONTRIBUTOR,2019-06-30T16:47:00Z,"At the end of `fix_maybe_exec_rustc`, there is a fall-through for all other dependencies.  `args.rustc` gets used down there, too (which in this case would be clippy-driver, which we don't want).

So, looking closer, my thought is that `BuildConfig::rustc_wrapper` could be changed to run for primary crates only. It looks like these things have evolved independently over time, and it's not clear if it must work the way it does now, but I don't see why it should. The only users appears to be clippy and fix, and both of them only want to run against the primary crates. `fix` appears to do a bunch of dancing around whether or not something is primary, but in the end, non-primary units only fall through to the end of `fix_maybe_exec_rustc` to call rustc, so I don't see that it is necessary in any way.

""Primary"" is defined as the units created by `generate_targets`.  There is a method `Context::is_primary_package` to determine if a unit is primary or not.

The `Compilation` struct will probably need to be reworked a little to support deciding which process to use.  I would also move the `rustfix_diagnostic_server` code in `Compilation::new` to the `fix` function in `fix.rs`, since it already has access to a `ProcessBuilder` (I think when this was originally written, it did not work that way).

Then I think the decision on which wrapper to use would go in [`prepare_rustc`](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/143aaed0eedda82f6684637ba1bf2d69b24c7799/src/cargo/core/compiler/mod.rs#L591-L601).  Perhaps it could pass a bool to `Compilation::rustc_process` to tell it is a primary unit? Whatever seems cleanest here, I'm not sure.

[These lines](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/143aaed0eedda82f6684637ba1bf2d69b24c7799/src/cargo/core/compiler/mod.rs#L183-L185) could then be removed. And all of the checks for `primary_package` in `fix.rs` could be removed.

298826602,ordian,OWNER,2019-06-30T10:08:20Z,"The complexity of this algorithm is quadratic in the worst case. I think we can do better here. We could serialize the document to `Vec<(u64, String)>` in one pass of `visit_nested_tables`. Each entry of this vec would represent a table. The `u64` will be an id of the table sorted as in the final `String`, and the second part of the tuple is the `String` representation of the table. Then all we need to do is to sort the vec by id and concatenate the strings.

How do we construct this vec? Something like this:
```rust
       // this number should be at least the number of tables with position `None`
       // alternatively, this could be computed in one pass of `visit_nested_tables`
       const MULTIPLIER: usize = 100500;
       // this would account for all `None` positions
       let mut increment = 0;
       let mut last_position = 0;
       let mut tables = Vec::new();
       self.visit_nested_tables(path, is_array_of_tables, &mut |t, p, is_array| {
            if let Some(pos) = t.position {
                last_position = pos;
                increment = 0;
            } else {
                increment += 1;
            }
            let id = last_position * MULTIPLIER + increment;
            let mut s = String::new();
            visit_table(&mut s, t, p, is_array);
            tables.push((id, s));
            Ok(())
        })?;
        tables.sort_by_key(|&(id, _)| id);

Fantastico! Headers will help you highlight segments of your web page. 

So far, we've used tags that stand on their own. However, we sometimes need to specify an attribute, which is information that the tag needs to do its work. For example, to display an image, we need an `<img>` tag, but we also need a source attribute so the browser knows the location of the image. We can add an attribute as follows:

```html
<img src=""https://octodex.github.com/images/vinyltocat.png"">
```

You'll also notice that the image tag doesn't need to close since it is considered to be an [empty](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp) tag.

Apply this suggested change, or follow the instructions below if you'd like to type out the code manually.

298846996,lubien,NONE,2019-06-30T19:49:13Z,"I'm kinda lost on this one, can you give me an example? Currently in this repo I found:

I'm doing like this:
```js
// catch-error-name.js
const create = context => {
	const options = {
		name: 'error',
		caughtErrorsIgnorePattern: '^_$',
		...context.options[0]
	};
```

```js
// filename-case.js
const create = context => {
	const chosenCases = getChosenCases(context);

// ...
function getChosenCases(context) {
	const option = context.options[0] || {};
```

```js
// no-keyword-prefix.js
const create = context => {
	const options = prepareOptions(context.options[0]);
```

```js
// prefer-add-event-listener.js
const create = context => {
	const options = context.options[0] || {};
```

This method sounds better:
```js
// prevent-abbreviations.js
const create = context => {
	const options = prepareOptions(context.options[0]);
```

After going to the site os JSON Schema I got into [this example with default](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/structuring.html?highlight=default#using-id-with-ref) I got this:

```js

const schema = [
	{
		type: 'object',
		properties: {
			terms: {
				type: 'array',
				default: ['todo', 'fixme', 'xxx'],
				items: {
					type: 'string'
				}
			},
			ignoreDatesOnPullRequests: {
				type: 'boolean',
				default: true
			}
		},
	}
];
```

Yes, and this only hides the breaking change by turning it into a runtime error. I've been thinking about other possible approaches:

1. introduce a sub-interface and require a cast (as we've done in other cases). The problem is that this doesn't scale well: we add `ExtendedProductHelper` now but what if we need more methods in the next version? `ExtendedExtendedProductHelper`?
2. Accept the breaking change and document it, on the assumption that clients probably don't implement this interface. The problem is in the ""probably""; also, it's a slippery slope.
3. Don't add those methods to `EntityHelper`. Instead, generate the query directly from the method generators. For SELECT we already have `selectStart()`; for DELETE we have to duplicate the whole method, but it's not huge either.

    We won't make those queries available to users through the interface (e.g. for custom query providers), but they're not that hard to rewrite from scratch anyway.

If we do a pumping wait in any of the update handlers, we end up running other callbacks, like shutdown's CommandManager.Dispose being called while we're waiting.

```suggestion
					// A pumping wait could possibly let CommandManager.Dispose be called before continuing here, check for disposed checks.

298840669,vaguerant,CONTRIBUTOR,2019-06-30T16:15:39Z,"The ""non"" is a tough one. Pierre obviously speaks in a heavily French-accented English, e.g. the ""little""/""leetle"" and his ""the"" definitely starts with a Z. The complicated part with ""non"" is that in French, the second N in ""non"" is silent. So a French guy saying ""non"" in French (""non"" is the French word for ""no"") vs. saying ""no"" with a French accent is practically identical.

I think whoever made the subtitles originally did a decent job making the subtitles read as French-accented, and ""non"" is a good way to represent that. ""Leetle"" and ""wheech"" are maybe a bit weaker because a non-English speaker might not be able to identify what words those are supposed to be.

I don't find any related proc though :/. If you find one, note that you might have to add {.noconv.} pragma to that release proc otherwise addQuitProc will complain.

The main limitation of that approach of hiding the context is that for multi-threading you need one context per thread, but it's fine to start with single-threaded support and redirect people who need multi-threading to the low-level API.

Alternatively there is a `getContext` proc that checks if the current thread as a context already allocated, if yes retrieves it if no create one.

For that CTX should be a {.threadvar.}, you can see an example of this here: https://github.com/status-im/nim-eth-keys/blob/b09f5ee894183d8e49c02b0d9c21c617a7d1ce6b/eth_keys/libsecp256k1.nim#L50-L119",https://github.com/status-im/nim-decimal/pull/2#discussion_r298835344,nim-decimal

So after further testing, this is the observed behavior:
- On non-oculus devices the game runs and behaves as expected.
- On oculus devices (i.e: Gear VR) starting the game prompts to insert the device into a headset.

Thanks for catching that! I'll look into making it settable.",https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/29824#discussion_r298842074,godot

Actually it is ;)... but this will only trigger an error if missing when you use these conditions in a game compiled for the C++ game engine: the generated C++ code from events will try to call these C++ functions, but won't have any header containing them.

Great job opening a pull request @UAbhati! I've gone ahead and closed your [previous issue](https://github.com/UAbhati/intro-html/issues/1). 

This pull request contains some content, but it doesn't have any of the HTML structure that tells a browser how to structure the content. All pages created with HTML must contain tags that identify it as such. The tags look like this:

```html
<html>
    <body>
        The HTML content goes here.
    </body>
</html>
```

You may notice two copies of the HTML tag, and two copies of the body tag. We call these the _opening_ and _closing_ tags. Let's look at the same code, but include a little explanation.

- `<html>` is the opening HTML tag
- `<body>` is the opening body tag
- `</body>` is the closing body tag
- `</html>` is the closing HTML tag

In HTML, spacing doesn't really matter. We've added some tabs to make the code easier to see, but the web browser will ignore the extra spacing. Now that you understand the building blocks of HTML, let's add HTML to the `index.html` file in your project.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add the `html` and `body` tags to `index.html`

Apply this suggested change, or follow the instructions below if you'd like to type out the code manually.

```suggestion
<html>

  <body>
    Hello there, awesome person! 
  </body>

</html>
```

1. Click on **Files Changed** to see the newly added `index.html` file.
1. Click on the ellipsis (...) and select **Edit file**.
1. Before the existing content, add an opening `<html>` tag, and an opening `<body>` tag.
1. After the existing content, add a closing `</body>` tag, and a closing `</html>` tag.
1. In the _Commit changes_ section, enter a commit message that describes what you've done.
1. Ensure you've selected _Commit directly to the `add-index` branch_.
1. Click on **Commit changes**.

Maybe we can postpone the thoughts to the conference in Berlin and think about the improvements from high level perspectives. Personally I have to say that reciving and returing a Collection in a service method not like EE guys always do. I prefer a typical services where domain object is passed to a method and another is returned or void, but not Collection. The collection is structurally complext object and here maybe domain object with collection and value objects would need to be encapsulated. Then no `instanceof` is needed and instead an `isA` method would return true/false representing type of the collection upon the simple value object. Then we can talk about immutable and threadsafe and easily tested objects.
